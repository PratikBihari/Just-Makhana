                    <h2>About Our Products</h2>
                    <h3>What is makhana?</h3>
                    <p>Makhana, also known as fox nuts or lotus seeds, are nutritious seeds harvested from the lotus flower. They are naturally gluten-free, high in protein, and low in calories, making them an excellent healthy snack option.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Where do you source your makhana from?</h3>
                    <p>Our makhana is sourced directly from farmers in Bihar, India, where the finest quality lotus seeds are cultivated in pristine wetlands. We work closely with local farming communities to ensure sustainable and ethical sourcing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Are your products organic?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, our makhana is naturally grown without the use of harmful pesticides or chemicals. While we're working on official organic certification, our products are cultivated using traditional, natural farming methods.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What's the difference between raw and roasted makhana?</h3>
                    <p>Raw makhana is unprocessed and can be roasted at home with your preferred seasonings. Roasted makhana is lightly processed for extra crunch and convenience, ready to eat straight from the package.</p>
